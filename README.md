# ESP32 Database HTTP Request Example

This code demonstrates how to make HTTP requests from an ESP32 microcontroller to fetch data from a database using the Wokwi online simulator.

## Overview

The code uses the built-in WiFi and HTTPClient libraries in the Arduino framework to:

1. Connect to a simulated WiFi network in Wokwi.
2. Make an HTTP GET request to a specified database URL every 2 seconds.
3. Print the HTTP response code and response data to the serial monitor.
4. Handle errors that may occur during the HTTP request process.

## Requirements

- Wokwi online simulator (https://wokwi.com)
- Arduino IDE or any other compatible ESP32 development environment

## Usage

1. Open the Wokwi online simulator (https://wokwi.com).
2. Create a new project and select the ESP32 board.
3. Copy the provided code and paste it into the Wokwi code editor.
4. Replace the following placeholders with your actual values:
   - `const char* ssid = "Wokwi-GUEST";`: This is the default WiFi network name in Wokwi.
   - `const char* pass = "";`: The Wokwi-GUEST network does not have a password.
   - `http.begin("https://s-m.com.sa/f.html");`: Replace with the URL of the database you want to fetch data from.
5. Click the "Run" button to simulate the code.
6. Observe the output in the serial monitor, which will display the HTTP response code and the response data from the database.

## Customization

You can customize the following aspects of the code:

- **Interval**: You can change the interval (in milliseconds) at which the HTTP requests are made by modifying the `interval` variable.
- **Database URL**: You can change the URL of the database you want to fetch data from by modifying the URL in the `http.begin()` function.
- **Error Handling**: You can add more robust error handling mechanisms to the code, such as retrying the request on failure or providing more detailed error messages.
- **Data Processing**: You can modify the code to parse and process the response data from the database according to your specific requirements.
